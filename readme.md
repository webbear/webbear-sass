#webbear's scss kit 2.0

The main purpose is providing a scss toolkit for faster writing scss. It is not intended to  build a full featured framework as bootstrap or foundation.

Grid tools (only flexbox) are very basic (as we are in the transition to css grids)- working with padding as gutter. If you need a more sophisticated approach, please refer to http://oddbird.net/susy/
